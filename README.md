# Unhandled Error in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling for POST requests.  When a POST request is made to `/users`, the server attempts to access `req.body` without checking if it exists or contains valid data.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, especially when the client sends a malformed or empty request.

The `bug.js` file showcases the faulty code. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected code, including robust error handling to address the issue.

## How to reproduce the bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
5. Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/users` with a malformed or empty request body using a tool like Postman or curl.

Observe the server's response. The buggy version will likely fail silently or throw an error. The solution will return appropriate error responses.
